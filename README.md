Todo Summary Assistant
This project is a full-stack web application developed as part of a Full Stack Internship Assignment. It allows users to manage their personal to-do items and leverage the power of a Large Language Model (LLM) to summarize pending tasks, then automatically send that summary to a designated Slack channel.
